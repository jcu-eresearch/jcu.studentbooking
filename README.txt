Introduction
============

uwosh.timeslot offers a simple way to allow users of a Plone site to
register for events (for example: training sessions).

To get started, add a SignupSheet object to your site and add Day and
TimeSlot object to it corresponding to the days and times that you
would like to allow users to register for.

Once the SignupSheet is published any logged in user can view it and signup for
available slots. When a user signs up for a slot they will recieve an email
confirmation. When a user returns to the SignupSheet they can see what times they
are signed up for and cancel their registration if they wish.

Each SignupSheet has a Manager Summary tab which allows site managers
to see who is registered for which times and export the registration
list to a .csv file.
